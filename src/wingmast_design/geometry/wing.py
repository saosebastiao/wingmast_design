Axes: chord along +X, span along +Z, airfoil normal along +Y. The pivot axis
(`pivot_frac` * chord) lies on X=0, Y=0.

Z layout (top to bottom):

Sections between z=0 and z=-transition_length morph from the root airfoil to the
spar circle with smoothstep easing (zero slope at both junctions; see

where the spar meets the airfoil.
