# Wing Design — Development Plan

The design specification lives in
[`guided_generative_design.md`](./guided_generative_design.md). The build history —
phase-by-phase analyses, findings, and the decisions log from the original shell-beam
build-out (Phases 1–F, complete) — is archived in [`findings.md`](./findings.md).
The audit-driven improvement backlog behind this plan is
[`improvement_backlog.md`](./improvement_backlog.md), which also records the intended
**manufacturing concept** (RTM'd / filament-wound beams, wrapped joints, hoop-wound
prestressed skin) that several phases below build toward.

This file is the **incremental build sequence** for the next stage: validity
hardening, manufacturability, and the performance harvest.

## Goal

A free-rotating, unstayed solid carbon-fiber **wingsail** built as a **space-frame
of unidirectional CFRP beams** wrapped and bound by a **filament-wound CFRP skin**
that simultaneously forms the airfoil surface. The structural members lie **on the
outer shell** — filament-winding the skin around shell-following beams *is* what
forms the structure. Beam cross-sections are sized **FEA-in-the-loop**, and the
wound skin is modeled as a **load-bearing shell**.

The repo is meant to evolve from a 5 m demo wingsail to a process applicable from
~1 m FPV drone wings up to >100 m wind turbine blades.

## Where we are (2026-06-10)

The shell-beam pipeline is built end-to-end and sized FEA-in-the-loop. Recorded
headlines: small (5 m) **30.15 kg** fully constrained / **27.67 kg** with 4 thickness
bands; medium (22 m) **2264.6 kg** (4-band, reproduced exactly 2026-06-10). The design
is **buckling/stiffness-governed — strength never binds** (Tsai-Wu R = 7.0 vs 2.0),
and beam-layout levers are mined out.

The 2026-06-10 validity sprint changed the picture: the medium gradient path is
**~23× faster** (cache fix; sizing ≈ 5–8 min, compute is no longer the rate limiter);
shadow prices put all binding-requirement mass on twist (−41 kg/deg, 4-band) and the
two closed-form buckling SFs; the **eigenvalue buckling solve (V.3) showed the
closed-form checks ≥1.6× (converged ~4–5×) conservative**, and the **width-based
panel check (V.3b) converted that to −18.8% on the medium 1-band design
(2471 → 2006 kg, eigen-verified)**; winding-pretension (P.2) measured **null** at the
optimum and is demoted. Headlines are NOT mesh-converged under the legacy checks
(V.2); the strip check + eigen verification is the honest pair going forward. Next:
V.4/V.5 load-completeness (will move mass *up*), then the V.6 re-baseline with
`panel_width_mode="strip"`, then P.0/P.1 (hollow members) against the new baseline.
Full record: [`findings.md`](./findings.md).

## Phases

Each phase ends in a runnable example under `examples/` and a passing smoke test.
**Findings are recorded in [`findings.md`](./findings.md)** (not here), with measured
wall-clock for every sizing run. Backlog references (V#/M#/P#) point into
[`improvement_backlog.md`](./improvement_backlog.md).

### Phase V.0 — Iteration-speed enablers

Phase V multiplies the number of sizing runs (mesh sweeps, re-baselines) and Phase P
adds parameter sweeps and multi-start; at ~1.5 h per medium sizing, compute speed is
the rate limiter on the whole plan. The FEA system is tiny (768 DOF — `splu` is
sub-millisecond), so wall-clock is almost certainly dominated by **per-element Python
loops run every evaluate** (K assembly, SensCache build, adjoint contraction, stress
recovery). Items V.0.2–V.0.5 compose multiplicatively and are exact (no formulation
change) except KS, which is testable.

- **V.0.1 Profile first (the gate). — DONE (2026-06-10).** `examples/41_profile_sizing.py`.
  Verdict: 93% of wall was the *uncached* `_beam_vm_grad_one` path (V.0.6), not general
  assembly. Fixed (SensCache threaded through `beam_con_jac`, exact): **1.13 s/iter raw
  vs ~26 s/iter recorded ≈ 23×**; medium sizing now ~6 min. See findings.md.
- **V.0.2 Vectorize the per-element Python work** — DEPRIORITIZED after the V.0.1 fix:
  post-fix profile shows no dominant wall (assembly 24%, shell recovery 17%, sensitivity
  10% of a small total). Re-profile before investing here (payoff returns if V.2 pushes
  n_levels up).
- **V.0.3 KS aggregation of the vector beam constraints. — REACTIVATED
  (2026-06-11) as the P.3 gate:** not for speed (the cache fix killed that wall)
  but for **smoothness** — the argmax-switching Jacobians of the max-based
  constraints stall both SLSQP and IPOPT on the sandwich migration. KS soft-max
  over elements AND load cases; conservative (re-validate vs hard-max, ρ≈50 per
  nlp-sizing conventions).
- **V.0.4 Process-parallel multi-start and sweeps.** The multistart wrapper is
  "serial, parallel-ready"; V.2 and P.4 are embarrassingly parallel across points.
  A process pool gives near-linear core scaling with no numerical work.
- **V.0.5 Warm-start continuation as standard sweep protocol.** Each sweep point
  starts from its neighbor's optimum; fine meshes start from resampled coarse-mesh
  solutions (the `resample_segment_radii` pattern). Attacks iteration *count*, which
  V.0.2–V.0.4 don't touch (examples 39/40 already proved warm-starting converges).
- **V.0.6 Opportunistic cleanups.** ~~The uncached `_beam_vm_grad_one` path~~ (DONE
  2026-06-10 — this WAS the wall; see V.0.1); sparse Cholesky instead of `splu` only
  if the profile shows factorization mattering at finer meshes (it doesn't today:
  `splu` ≈ 0.3 s / 10 medium iterations).
- **V.0.7 Engineering guardrails. — CI REMOVED (2026-06-15, user decision).** The
  GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`: fast unit job on push/PR +
  nightly sizing job) was deleted — CI/CD is not wanted for this single-developer
  research repo; the suite is run locally. The `sizing` pytest marker is KEPT (it
  still selects the fast vs slow split for `uv run pytest -m "not sizing"` locally;
  19 SLSQP tests ≥5 s, fast subset 149 tests / 12.2 s). The example smoke layer and
  config-flag smoke matrix are no longer CI-bound; run on demand if useful.
  (Toolbox #2, #3, #5)
- **V.0.8 Python version.** Migrated to **3.13** (2026-06-09; full suite green,
  160/160). **3.14 is blocked solely by build123d 0.10.0** (`requires-python <3.14`,
  OCP pin `<7.9`; the cp314 OCP wheels already exist and build123d's dev branch
  already supports `<3.15` + OCP 7.9) — bump to 3.14 when build123d's next release
  ships; that's where the real interpreter gains live (tail-call interpreter,
  incremental GC).

V.0.1 runs now; the rest pull in as the profile directs. Don't block V.1 on this —
shadow prices is a few independent lines.

### Phase V — Validity hardening

Make the model behave like the real structure before harvesting levers. Three of
these fixes may move the honest baseline *up*; lever gains must be measured against a
trustworthy baseline, not the current one.

- **V.1 Shadow prices. — DONE (2026-06-10).** `result.shadow_prices` (FD-validated
  0.02–0.5%; `examples/42_shadow_prices.py`). Headline (4-band): twist **−41.3 kg/deg**
  (cheapest requirement), beam/panel buckling SF +266/+152 kg/SF-unit, deflection +
  σ_allow free. Renegotiate twist first; V.3 prices the buckling SFs in fidelity terms.
  See findings.md. (P#8)
- **V.2 Mesh-convergence study of the optimized design. — DONE (2026-06-10).**
  `examples/43_mesh_convergence.py`: n_levels 6→10 gives 2807→2486→2271 kg (−9–11%
  per step, no plateau, all feasible/buckling-governed) — headlines NOT mesh-converged,
  bias unconservative as predicted; 16×12 diverged (diagnostic). 20-beam spot ≈ equal
  total mass, consistent with the V#1 ∝n mis-scaling — P.4 stays gated. Conclusion
  feeds V.3: fix the physics, not the mesh. See findings.md. (V#9, V#3)
- **V.3 Eigenvalue buckling check (K + Kσ). — DONE (2026-06-10).**
  `structural/geometric_stiffness.py` + `structural/eigen_buckling.py`
  (reference-validated), `examples/45_eigen_buckling.py`. Verdict: worst λ_cr = 2.443
  vs the closed-form's claimed 1.5 (≥1.6× conservative; λ → 5.67 on finer meshes of
  the same design → lower bound); worst mode = distributed skin-normal waving;
  hoop-pretension parametric is **null** at this optimum (λ 2.443→2.445, mode cluster)
  → P.2 demoted. Follow-up that harvests this: **V.3b width-based panel check**
  (physical strip width + per-direction D, calibrated against the eigen solve) —
  fixes the level AND the ∝n mis-scaling, unlocks P.4, then V.6 re-baseline.
  See findings.md. (V#1, V#2)
- **V.3b Width-based panel-buckling check. — DONE (2026-06-10).** Opt-in
  `panel_width_mode="strip"` (`skin_panel_widths`); analytic Jacobian exact in both
  modes (FD-validated). Calibration: implied capacity 5.14× at the old optimum vs
  converged eigen ~5.7 (conservative side, ~10%). **Harvest: medium 1-band 2471.4 →
  2006.3 kg (−18.8%)**, eigen-verified (λ_cr 2.286 ≥ 1.5). Compression-direction D
  (V#2) deliberately left open; kc=4 SS-edge caveat documented. Default flips to
  "strip" at the V.6 re-baseline; P.4 unlocked. `examples/46_width_based_panels.py`.
  (V#1)
- **V.4 Self-weight + inertial/heel load cases. — DONE (2026-06-10).**
  `accel_vectors` body loads + the λᵀ·∂f/∂x adjoint term (FD-validated).
  Measured: +15.5% on the medium strip baseline with upright + 30° heel gravity
  (2006.3 → 2316.9 kg). The 1 g lateral slam static-equivalent is envelope-dominating
  (diagnostic: → +110%, unconverged) — **deferred to the V#12 load-envelope
  decision**; V.6 standard set = upright + heel. `examples/47_self_weight.py`. (V#5)
- **V.5 Distributed panel pressure + skin bending stress in the failure check. —
  DONE (2026-06-10).** Skin-distributed projection ~neutral (−1.6%, noise floor;
  adopted as standard), strip-bending failure term σ_b = 0.75qw²/t² measures zero
  effect at medium scale (skin strength margin ~30×) — kept as the guard for
  thin-skin / high-pressure / large-scale regimes. Buckling–pressure interaction +
  Tsai-Wu bending deferred (recorded). `examples/48_panel_pressure.py`. (V#4)
- **V.6 Re-baseline. — DONE (2026-06-10).** New eigen-verified headlines (strip +
  upright/heel gravity + distributed pressure; slam deferred): **small 25.13 kg
  (4-band, λ_cr 2.00) / medium 2248.0 kg (1-band, λ_cr 2.26)**. Medium 4-band found
  only a worse basin (+4.4%) — banding under strip-mode buckling is being settled by
  the P#9 parallel multistart. Beam-buckling SF now carries the dominant shadow
  price (+531 kg/SF) → P.1 hollow members is the right next lever. Artifacts
  exported (`examples/49_rebaseline.py`). All P-levers measure against these.

- **V.7 Per-load-case constraint classes (serviceability vs ultimate). — TODO
  (queued 2026-06-15).** The sizer currently applies ONE constraint set uniformly
  across all aero×accel combos: `tip_defl`/`tip_twist` (serviceability) and
  `stress`/`buckling`/`eigen` (ultimate) are all evaluated as the worst over every
  combo, INCLUDING the slam accels (`evaluate(x)[2]` = max deflection over all
  combos, `laminate_sizing.py:756`). That mis-sizes survival cases: a once-in-a-
  lifetime 3 g wave slam is an ULTIMATE case where only failure (fracture/strength
  + buckling collapse) matters — deflection/twist are operational serviceability
  criteria and should NOT govern it — yet slam's huge tip deflection dominates the
  deflection constraint and inflates mass (user-caught, 2026-06-15; it drove the
  pinned 3 g run toward ~1.6 t). **Capability to add:** tag each load combo (or
  accel vector) with a constraint class — `serviceability` (operational gravity/
  heel: deflection + twist + strength + buckling) vs `ultimate` (slam: strength +
  buckling + eigen only, with possibly a reduced SF and only a geometric-validity
  deflection guardrail to keep the linear FEA valid). Route the `defl`/`twist`
  providers + their KS aggregation over the serviceability combos only; route
  strength/buckling over all. One run then yields the correctly mixed
  serviceability/ultimate envelope. Needs an FD-validation pass on the
  subset-aggregated `defl`/`twist` gradients (the KS combo-subset is the new bit).
  **Interim workaround in use:** `runs/slam_survival.py` relaxes deflection to a
  5 %-span guardrail + twist to 20° for the slam run, then envelopes (max) against
  the operational 1021.6 kg headline — gives the right survival mass but as two
  designs, not one native envelope. (V#12 slam load envelope; supersedes the
  uniform-constraint assumption baked in since V.4.)

- **V.8 Failure-only slam re-baseline. — IN PROGRESS (2026-06-16).** Supersede the
  deflection-overstated slam numbers (V.4's +110% 1 g figure; V#12's +53.5% @ 3 g
  and the 2 g diagnostic) with the failure-only envelope: strength + buckling +
  eigen govern, with tip deflection demoted to a geometric guardrail (linear-FEA
  validity) only — the slam masses to date were inflated by the 2%-span tip-
  deflection serviceability budget, which should NOT govern a survival/ultimate
  case. The failure-only 3 g run (`runs/slam_survival.py`) gave 1575.3 kg — but
  **that rating is now INVALID at converged mesh** (its λ 3.77 was an n=8 artifact;
  converged worst slam λ ≤ 1.25 < 1.5, no plateau by n=48 — see the survival
  mesh-eigen finding). So V.8 is NOT done: the failure-only formulation is right,
  but the buckling must be gated at a CONVERGED mesh, and for slam the closed-form
  is non-conservative → the survival design needs resizing and is HEAVIER (TBD).
  Blocked on identifying the governing converged slam buckling mode first (task
  #23) — spanwise vs chordwise/local — since the verification mesh hasn't settled.
  Generalize via V.7. (V#12; depends on V.7, V.9, task #23.)
- **V.9 In-loop eigenvalue constraint (analytic dλ/dx). — DEMOTED back after the
  prize was measured (2026-06-16).** Briefly elevated because the closed-form
  beam-buckling model is non-conservative under slam (it let the optimizer drop
  the rings while the true λ < 1). But `runs/eigen_harvest.py` measured the
  performance prize: sizing to the *true* eigenvalue would save only **~14 %
  (~145 kg)** on the headline, AND the true eigen is a **cliff** (a 17 % SF cut
  crashed λ 2.76→0.83), so the SF-1.5 buffer is partly real protection and V.9
  would size to the cliff edge. So V.9 is a **modest, risk-tradeoff lever, not an
  obvious build.** Its remaining VALUE is correctness-for-slam (so the sizer can't
  silently drop rings) rather than mass — and the **pinned ring-size floor is an
  adequate interim workaround** for slam-sized runs. Build only if a future regime
  makes the closed-form blindness bite again. Cross-refs V.7/V.8, the lateral-
  bracing work, P.6. (Toolbox #7.)
- **V.10 Mesh-converged VERIFICATION protocol. — RESOLVED as a protocol fix, NOT a
  re-baseline (2026-06-16).** First read (the n=12 re-baseline + the fixed-design
  diagnostic) looked alarming — λ falling 2.76→~1.3 — but the k=5 eigen-mesh-behavior
  sweep (`runs/eigen_mesh_behavior.py`) showed that was **under-resolution →
  cluster convergence**: the coarse mesh overstiffens the whole spectrum, λ1
  overshoots low at n=12, then recovers to a **converged cluster floor λ ≈ 1.5–1.6
  at n≥24**. So the **1021.6 kg headline is VALID** (converged λ ≥ 1.5, sized right
  to its SF-1.5 margin) and the closed-form foundation model is **well-calibrated**
  (SF 1.5 ↔ converged eigen ~1.5), not non-conservative; the attempted n=12
  re-baseline (704 kg) was gated to the overshoot and is **discarded**. **Fix
  (cheap):** VERIFY buckling at **n≥24** (eigen-only, ~15–40 s) judging the
  converged cluster floor over the lowest 2–3 modes — make that the standard eigen
  check; SIZING stays at n=8 (calibrated closed-form). No mass re-baseline needed.
  Remaining: a converged braced eigen re-check of the 3 g survival design (its λ
  3.77 is an n=8 value). Brazier safe (6.6×). (V#… mesh.)

Deferred validity items: aeroelastic load feedback + divergence/flutter → Phase H;
Brazier crush → CHECKED 2026-06-16 (6.6× margin, not governing); environmental/
fatigue knockdowns → with the M.4 as-built pass; root/bearing compliance → M.5.
(V#6, V#7, V#10, V#11)

### Phase M — Manufacturability

Encode the manufacturing concept's constraints so designs stay buildable. M.1–M.2 gate
any "as-built" headline claim; later items can interleave with Phase P.

- **M.1 Beam buildability classification.** At the geometry stage, tag each beam
  RTM-vs-wound (path convexity / fiber bridging) and solid-vs-hollow (straightness);
  reject or re-route infeasible sections before mold design. (M#4)
- **M.2 Ply discretization.** Round band thicknesses/layup fractions to integer ply
  counts (~0.25 mm/ply) with a mandatory first-layer hoop wind floor; FEA re-verify via
  the existing bump-and-reverify pattern. (M#1, M#2)
- **M.3 Windable-angle constraints.** Constrain layup fractions to windable angle sets
  per region; longer-term, Phase G's planner feeds the as-wound orientation map back
  into the CLT. (M#3)
- **M.4 Bondline + as-built mass.** Wrapped-joint/bondline checks (shear flow, peel —
  post-processing on the existing solution) and an as-built mass model (wound Vf,
  turnaround overlaps, joints, hardware); report ideal vs as-built mass separately.
  (M#5, M#7, V#8)
- **M.5 Root socket model.** Replace the rigid clamp with the slot-and-bond socket
  (finite stiffness + bond-area check); size the engagement length from recovered root
  reactions. (M#8, V#11)

### Phase P — Performance harvest

One lever at a time, each against the V.6 re-baselined numbers, finding recorded
before the next lever starts.

- **P.0 Sizer extensibility refactor. — DONE (2026-06-10).** `DesignVector`
  (named-block x layout) + `ConstraintSpec` (one list entry per constraint; scipy
  dicts, Jacobian registration, and shadow-price attribution derive from it).
  Behavior-preserving verified: 189 tests green + the V.6 medium headline reproduced
  bit-exactly. IPOPT fallback unchanged (trigger: SLSQP stalls or DVs > ~150 — watch
  during P.1). (Toolbox #1, #4)
- **P.1 Hollow members. — P#1a core tube DONE (2026-06-10, corrected): POSITIVE
  −8.3% (2248.0 → 2060.7 kg, eigen λ 2.49).** First run was an artifact (bonds not
  assembled — user-caught); the bonded tube stays minimal (8 kg, r at the 20 mm
  bound — centroidal bending is indeed worthless) but acts as a **torsion spine**:
  twist un-binds (−50.7 → 0 kg/deg) and the skin sheds 180 kg of torsion plies.
  Running-best medium: **2060.7 kg**. Follow-ups: tube_r_min sweep, tube CAD export,
  M#5 wrapped-joint model for the bond stiffness. **Next: P#1b hollow straight
  FORM-beam segments** — beam-buck SF still +455 kg/SF; paths measured exactly
  straight in-wing (ruled planform), spec committed. `examples/50_core_tube.py`.
  **P#1b DONE (2026-06-10): tube + hollow form beams = 1924.6 kg (eigen λ 2.54) —
  running best, −14.4% vs the V.6 baseline.** Hollow-only is no win (+1.2%): the
  levers are complementary (spine frees twist, hollow walls then harvest the beams).
  Walls at the 1 mm floor (4 plies — M#2 rounding pending); the cold start was
  eigen-REJECTED (λ 0.91) → warm-start protocol mandatory on this config.
  `examples/51_hollow_beams.py`. Next: P.4 n_beams sweep (user-requested). (P#1)
- **P.2 Skin prestress + compression cross-members. — DEMOTED (2026-06-10):** the
  V.3 eigen parametric shows λ_cr 2.443→2.445 under 5–20 MPa hoop pretension at the
  current optimum (the critical-mode cluster is pretension-insensitive); revisit only
  if the binding set changes after V.3b/V.6. Original scope: winding pretension as a
  self-equilibrated load case (the build already commits to the tensioned hoop wrap);
  spreader struts / shear webs concentrate the equilibrating compression into short,
  buckling-cheap members. New DVs: strut radii + pretension magnitude(s); the adjoint
  gains a `λᵀ·∂f_pre/∂x` term (prestress load depends on DVs). Use a
  direction-resolved (biaxial) buckling check — hoop pretension is transverse to the
  spanwise panel compression. Guard with a prestress-retention knockdown and
  strut-foot peel checks. (P#2, P#3)
  **[Note 2026-06-16: for the SLAM role specifically, the merged lateral
  ring-bracing work (2026-06-15) supersedes the P.2 compression-cross-member /
  F.2 diagonal family — see V.8/V.9 and the ring-bracing findings.]**
- **P.3 Sandwich (cored) skin. — MACHINERY DONE, LEVER OPEN (2026-06-11).**
  φ(t,c) sandwich D + wrinkle/crimp checks merged & FD-validated; the measured
  migration trajectory falls to ~1032 kg (−46%) but **SLSQP stalls unconverged on
  every leg — the documented IPOPT trigger is met** (119 DVs, persistent stalls).
  **CLOSED (2026-06-11) via KS (ρ=50) + IPOPT: 1679.3 kg converged + feasible +
  eigen λ 3.55 — running best, −25.3% vs the V.6 baseline.** t_core 4.3 mm,
  faces 1.91 mm; skin 519 + core 61 kg vs 1246 monolithic. Six hard-max attempts
  failed first (argmax Jacobian kinks — both optimizer families); KS smoothing
  was the unlock. KS-conservative local optimum (hard-max polish + multi-start =
  optional refinements). Beams now 65% of mass → V.3c next.
  (P#5; P.2 redundancy resolved — prestress is null.) (P#5)
- **P.4 n_beams sweep. — DONE (2026-06-10).** n ∈ {12…28} on the running-best
  config (tube + hollow), full warm protocol + eigen verification per point,
  parallel. **16 beams is the measured optimum** (1924.6 kg, λ 2.54); n=20 +2.5%
  (λ 1.51); n=24 closed-form-feasible but **eigen-rejected (λ 1.22)** — above 16
  the design is eigen-limited, not closed-form-limited. The historical default is
  now a measured optimum. `examples/52_nbeams_sweep.py`. (P#4)
- **P.4b n_beams RE-SWEEP. — QUEUED after V.10 (2026-06-16).** P.4's "16 optimal"
  is stale on two axes: (1) regime — it ran pre-foundation / pre-sandwich /
  pre-datum_ortho on the 1924.6 kg (pre-correction) design; (2) MESH — its verdict
  rested on the per-point eigen verification (n=16 λ 2.54 / n=20 1.51 / n=24
  eigen-rejected 1.22), and V.10 showed that coarse-mesh eigen is optimistic ~2×,
  so those bounding thresholds were inflated (P.4's own note: "when future levers
  slim members toward λ=1.5, move the eigen check in-loop" — this is that moment).
  GATE: re-sweep only AFTER V.10 establishes the converged-mesh eigen gate, else
  every n-point inherits the same ~2× optimistic bias and the comparison is
  meaningless. Re-sweep n ∈ {12…24} at n_levels ≥ 12 on the current
  foundation+sandwich+datum_ortho regime with the converged eigen gate; the optimum
  may move (converged eigen worse for all n ⇒ pushes toward fewer/heavier beams,
  while the survival design's co-binding panel buckling pushes toward more
  beams/smaller panels). (P#4, V.10.)
  — **ATTEMPTED + DEFERRED (2026-06-16):** `runs/nbeams_resweep.py` cold-chained
  each n_beams at the current config; n=12 cascaded infeasible through A0/A/B (all
  unconverged, no incumbent, eigen fine) — the cold-chain-per-n_beams hits the same
  restoration stall as the slam runs, so it can't cleanly compare n_beams. Soft
  signal (n=12 infeasible on a closed-form constraint, likely panel buckling at the
  larger panels) is consistent with 16 being near-optimal; the 1021.6 kg headline
  stands. A rigorous re-sweep needs a **chordwise warm-start** (remap the 16-beam
  headline to each n_beams) — deferred, low priority since the headline is valid.
- **P.5 Cheap-iteration levers.** Once gradients are fast: multi-start at scale, more
  and chordwise thickness bands, per-band layup revisit. (P#9, P#10)
- **P.6 Re-extract shadow prices on the 1021.6 kg optimum. — DONE (2026-06-16).**
  `runs/shadow_prices.py` (SLSQP warm from the IPOPT optimum, 104 s, reproduced
  1021.6 kg). Result: **beam buckling is the SOLE binding lever, `buckling_sf_beam`
  = +1030.8 kg/SF** (every other shadow price exactly 0). That is ~2× the old V.6
  +531 kg/SF — the lighter foundation design is *more* buckling-critical. The cheap
  STRUCTURAL beam-buckling levers (tube/hollow/foundation/rings) are all harvested;
  the remaining harvest is the closed-form CONSERVATISM (meets SF 1.5 while true
  eigen 2.76 = 1.84×) → only **V.9 in-loop eigen** recovers it. Prize being
  measured by an SF-sweep (`runs/eigen_harvest.py`, mass vs true eigen). See
  findings.md.

### Phase G — Filament-winding path planner

- `wingmast_design.manufacturing.winding` — continuous winding passes forming the
  airfoil + reinforcing joints/buckling-prone members; output robot/G-code paths
  + per-pass fiber-orientation map feeding the CLT skin model (closes M.3).

**Deliverable: animated winding sequence + CLT-homogenized skin stiffness map.**

### Phase H — Verification, fixed-point iteration, scaling

- Re-mesh the **as-designed** assembly; re-solve every load case; check stress,
  deflection, buckling, fatigue.
- Aeroelastic closure: loads recomputed on the deformed/twisted shape, iterate to a
  fixed point; **divergence/flutter check for the free-rotating wing** (V#6).
- Parametrize span/chord/taper for FPV-drone-wing / turbine-blade retargeting;
  add dynamic (vortex shedding) and impact cases.

**Deliverable: certified-on-paper wingsail with documented load envelope and
safety margins.**

See [`guided_generative_design.md` → Future optimizations](./guided_generative_design.md#future-optimizations--directions)
for the longer backlog (skin-vs-beam mass trade, outer geometry optimization,
interior-truss comparison baseline).

## Tooling

- **Geometry viewer:** examples that produce build123d geometry call
  `wingmast_design.show_in_viewer(part)`, which sends to the **OCP CAD Viewer** VS Code
  extension (bernhard-42) on port 3939. If the viewer isn't running, the call is a
  no-op with a printed hint.
- **ParaView 6.x** for FEA field visualization via the `just view` / `just shot`
  recipes (`paraview/*.py`).
- **Bytecode:** `PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX` is exported from the justfile so generated
  `.pyc` land in a single gitignored `.pycache/` instead of scattering through the
  source tree. Use `just`-based entry points to inherit it.
- **Python interpreter for VS Code:** select `.venv/bin/python` so basedpyright
  resolves `build123d`, `aerosandbox`, etc.
